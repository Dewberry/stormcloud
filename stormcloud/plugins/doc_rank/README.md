# doc rank

## Ranked Document Creation Plugin

### Summary

Plugin creates documents which mirror the s3 JSON output created as part of SST runs with additional attributes:

- rank
    - this includes both a "true rank" and a "declustered rank"
    - "true rank" refers to the ranking of each storm within its respective year
    - "declustered rank" refers to the ranking of each storm within its respective year with a filter applied ensuring that SST events that overlap in temporal extent are not all ranked, which would potentially count a single storm system which affects multiple runs as multiple storms; when an SST event does not pass the filter, it is assigned a declustered rank of -1

- png URL
    - this is a publicly accessible URL pointing to a PNG displaying SST model results

- tropical storms
    - this is a list of dictionaries which contain attributes of all tropical storms which overlap the SST run
    - example:
    ```JSON
    [
    {
        "id": "1979191N22264",
        "name": "BOB",
        "start": "1979-07-11",
        "end": "1979-07-12",
        "nature": "TS"
    }
    ]
    ```
- category
    - a reformulation of watershed name and transposition domain

### Input and Output Format

For explanation of required inputs, see the [plugin YAML file](./doc_rank.yaml). This section describes in greater depth the required format of input data and the anticipated format of plugin output

#### Tropical Storm Data

When providing an s3 URI pointing to tropical storm data used in populating the tropical storms attribute, the JSON in question should be in a list in the following format:

```JSON
[
    {
        "id": "unique_id1",
        "name": "NAME1",
        "start": "1979-07-11",
        "end": "1979-07-12",
        "nature": "TS"
    }
]
```

#### Ranked Document Output

Output generated by this plugin should be in a list following this format:

```JSON
[
  {
		"id": "<watershed>_<domain>_<duration>h_19790201",
		"parent_s3_uri": "s3://tempest/watersheds/<watershed>/<watershed>-transpo-area-<domain>/<duration>h/docs/19790201.json",
		"png_url": "https://tempest.s3.amazonaws.com/watersheds/<watershed>/<watershed>-transpo-area-<domain>/<duration>h/pngs/19790201.png",
		"ranks": {
			"true_rank": 240,
			"declustered_rank": 71
		},
		"categories": {
			"lv10": "<watershed>",
			"lv11": "<watershed> > <domain>"
		},
    "tropical_storms": [
      {
        "id": "1979191N22264",
        "name": "BOB",
        "start": "1979-07-11",
        "end": "1979-07-12",
        "nature": "TS"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

##### Optional Tropical Storms Attribute
As a note, you can see that in this example content, there are no tropical storms included in the list associated with the 'tropical_storms' attribute. This is because there were no tropical storms provided in the input JSON which intersected the temporal extent of this SST run. Additonally, the 'tropical_storms' attribute is only present in cases in which an s3 URI is given with tropical storm data. Without the tropical storm s3 URI, an equivalent document but with no 'tropical_storms' attribute is created (see below)

```JSON
[
  {
		"id": "<watershed>_<domain>_<duration>h_19790201",
		"parent_s3_uri": "s3://tempest/watersheds/<watershed>/<watershed>-transpo-area-<domain>/<duration>h/docs/19790201.json",
		"png_url": "https://tempest.s3.amazonaws.com/watersheds/<watershed>/<watershed>-transpo-area-<domain>/<duration>h/pngs/19790201.png",
		"ranks": {
			"true_rank": 240,
			"declustered_rank": 71
		},
		"categories": {
			"lv10": "<watershed>",
			"lv11": "<watershed> > <domain>"
		}
	}
]
```
